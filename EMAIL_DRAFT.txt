Subject: Re: New upload: cqjtuthesis v1.0.1 (Update to address issues)

Dear Erik Braun,

Thank you very much for your feedback and guidance. I apologize for the issues in the initial submission.

I have completely restructured the package to comply with CTAN standards and addressed your comments in the new version (v1.0.1), which I am about to upload:

1.  **Project Structure**: The package is now organized into `tex/`, `doc/`, and `examples/` directories to separate code, documentation, and examples properly.
2.  **Filenames**: All generic filenames (e.g., `main.tex`) have been renamed with the `cqjtuthesis-` prefix (e.g., `cqjtuthesis-doc.pdf`, `cqjtuthesis-bachelor.tex`) to avoid conflicts.
3.  **README**: Only a single `README.md` is included now.
4.  **Logo Usage**: The university logo included is strictly for identifying the institution for thesis purposes. I have added a copyright notice (`examples/figures/COPYRIGHT.md`) clarifying that the logo belongs to Chongqing Jiaotong University and is used here under fair use principles for academic templates.

Regarding my real name: It is **[您的真实拼音姓名]**. I am happy to provide it for internal records.

I hope the new upload meets the requirements. Please let me know if any further changes are needed.

Best regards,

broadcreate
